# SecScripts - Collection of random security/ctf related scripts
Collection of random shell scripts, aliases, one-off programs, etc. I wrote related to infosec and CTF's.

# Scripts

## [[infra/wanip.alias]]
Aliases for grabbing your external ipv4 or ipv6 address, using the opendns resolvers.

## [[decode/rot13.alias]]
Simple alias that uses `tr` to do a alphabet-based rot13, allowing usage in piped commands

## [[osint/crt-graburl.sh]]
Resolve all common names for a domain through the https://crt.sh/ search function. Handy for an additional quick enumeration of subdomains on top of proper tooling or for a quick scan.
